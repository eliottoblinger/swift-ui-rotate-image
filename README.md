# üåê Rotate Image - SwiftUI Project

Welcome to the Rotate Image SwiftUI App! This project demonstrates how to build a SwiftUI app that displays an image. Each time you click on the image, it rotates by 90 degrees.

## Project Description

The Rotate Image SwiftUI App showcases how SwiftUI can easily handle user interactions and update the user interface accordingly. The app displays an image, and when you tap on it, the image rotates by 90 degrees. Each subsequent click will rotate the image further, creating an interactive and engaging experience.
  
## What I Learned

In this project, I focused on the following concepts:

1. **SwiftUI Image Display:** I used SwiftUI to display an image within the app.

2. **Handling Image Rotation:** I implemented the image rotation functionality, allowing the image to rotate by 90 degrees with each click.
